## About me

My name is Daniel Moreira, I'm 30 years old, and I live in a small city near Aveiro and Coimbra.

I'm a **front-end developer** with 3+ years of experience who likes to **learn new things** and **embrace challenges**. In this 3 years I have been working in a wide range of areas such as user/projects/smart park management, finances, and streaming.

In my free time I like to watch movies/series/sports, play with my pets and visit new places.

## About this project

The goal of this project is to be my **online personal draft book**.

When I try to learn a new technology, tool, paradigm, concept or whatever, I like to write down a **gist** of what I've learned because it's easier for me to **understand** and to **remind me** later. So, instead of writing on a physical sheet, I will write it here where I can access it from everywhere.

Even though the goal isn't to reach readers/viewers, everyone is welcome to read my notes and ping me (by [email](mailto:drmoreira@outlook.pt) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drmoreira) / [GitHub](https://github.com/DanielRodriguesMoreira)) for comments/suggestions/questions :wink:
